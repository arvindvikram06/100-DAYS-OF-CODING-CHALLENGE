//Problem
//Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "schtschurowskia", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.

//We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains4 or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is easy to pronounce. For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.

//You are given a string S consisting of N lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above â€” print YES if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.

//For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters 

//{a,e,i,o,u} and the consonants are the other 
//21 characters.

//input
//The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines of inputThe first line of each test case contains a single integer 
//N, the length of string S.The second line of each test case contains the string S.
