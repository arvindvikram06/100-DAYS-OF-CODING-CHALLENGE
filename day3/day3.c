// Problem
// King loves to go on tours with his friends.
// King has N cars that can seat 5 people each and M cars that can seat 7 people each.
// Determine the maximum number of people that can travel together in these cars.
// Input Format
// The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
// The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M â€” the number of 5-seaters and 7-seaters, respectively.
// output
// Output Format
// For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of people that can travel together.
